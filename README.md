# github-scoial-preview-api
API service that retrieve Social Previews of GitHub repositories. 


### Reason:
I noticed that there are a lot of people (like myself) looking for an api to fetch github social preview, surprisingly github api doesn't provide that so here is one I made that scrapes users pages directly. 

### URL:
https://5v740xyezb.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/

### Instructions:
you can either use the UI of the link above or dierctly call for data using URL + `/api/?user=${username}&repo=${repo}`
